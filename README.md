# Catalyst NEXT
The New and Exciting of Tomorrow
# What is NEXT?
This is a repository of potential future Catalyst projects in their pre-alpha forms
# What will be and what won't?
Whether or not a project will go mainstream depends on the following factors:
1. General development success \
2. Community attention \
3. Potential use cases for the software
# Why does it exist?
Several projects are started but flop before they are pushed to the GitHub organization. This repository will allow them to be seen and evaluated by the community
# Folder naming convention
Folder names will follow this pattern:
Generic Name (defines exactly what the software is. example: Calculator) \
The primary programming language (example: Python) \
The stack/framework in use (example PyGame) \
For example, the paint program I am working on is called PaintApplication.Python.PyGame
